Simcenter Webapp Server is a web-based tool that enables you to create engineering webapps in your company. As a model owner it’s an easy and safe way to spread your knowledge because you can grant the usage of this model through a customized webapp to anyone you give access. There are numerous applications where this can be of high value. Think for example about your presales/sales colleagues throughout the world who need tools for proof the performance of your products in front of their customers.  
Since release 2022.1 it is possible to create engineering webapps from a Functional Model Unit (FMU) created with other authoring tools such as: 
* Other system simulation tools like [Simcenter Flomaster](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/products/simcenter/flomaster.html )
* 3D simulation tools, such as [Simcenter Star-CCM+](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/products/simcenter/STAR-CCM.html )
* The [Simcenter ROM builder](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/products/simulation-test/rom-builder.html ) that creates an FMU based on your model or experimental results
* All third-party tools that can create a tool independent co-simulation FMU according to the FMI 2.0 standard.

## The value of knowledge is in accessibility 
The time and knowledge you’ve invested in creating your models is of high value, not everybody can do the same and many important decisions rely on them. Many of your colleagues or other connections would be glad to leverage your expertise even if they’re not an engineer themselves. With Simcenter Webapp Server you can spread your knowledge and support them with easy and safe access, which means: 
* No tool installation for end-users, the engineering webapps are available within a web browser.
* You can make sure that everyone is using the right version of the webapp and the FMU at any time, no versioning headache anymore. 
* It protects your IP. Since you centralize all simulations on a server there’s no direct access to model IP. 
* You control the permissions and can manage user access at every moment.
