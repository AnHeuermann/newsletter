#### Our Booth

Annika Kuhlmann and [Stefan Wischhusen](mailto:wischhusen@xrg-simulation.de?subject=Meeting%20request) are looking forward to meeting you at our booth in the exhibition area. Sneak around for an eye-2-eye conversation at any time.

#### Our Vendor Presentation: Welcome to the world of XRG!

In this presentation given in Room Silver, we will introduce you to our latest advancements and special features in Modelica libraries and tools, showcasing the extremely enhanced capabilities of our [HumanComfort Library](https://www.xrg-simulation.de/en/products/xrg-library/humancomfort), [HVAC Library](https://www.xrg-simulation.de/index.php/en/products/xrg-library/xrg-hvac-library), [ClaRaPlus Library](https://www.claralib.com/index.php?lang=en) and our very efficient [Score Excel AddIn](https://www.xrg-simulation.de/index.php/en/products/applications/score) enabling simulations for everyone.

Discover how these multi simulation platform solutions empower you to efficiently simulate and model diverse scenarios, optimize thermal behavior, analyze HVAC systems, simulate power plants, and remotely control FMUs or Dymola from the familiar Excel interface. 

#### Our Talks
