Modelon is proud to be a silver sponsor of the upcoming International Modelica Conference. This year’s conference is an in-person event taking place in Aachen, Germany on October 9-11, 2023.
The Modelica Conference brings together users, library developers, tool vendors, and language designers to discuss the latest findings and trends related to the family of Modelica standards. 
As contributions to the conference program, Modelon will host a tutorial session, a vendor presentation, present a couple of papers, and be available for your questions and to talk shop at our booth. And last but not least: we are hiring! Looking for a job? Come talk to us at our booth! 
	
#### Tutorial Session: Techno-economical assessment of industrial infrastructure – optimal design and control to reach net-zero 
Dynamic optimization based on CasADi has been around for a number of years and the advantages of this dynamic trajectory-based optimization approach are well understood. However, it has always been quite inaccessible and hard to integrate into engineering design workflows. With Modelon Impact, we are introducing a fully integrated solution to enable this exciting and powerful technology.  
In this tutorial, we will showcase advanced workflows of Modelon Impact – Modelon’s cloud-based system simulation platform and enables the linking of Modelica with CasADi. Modelon Impact is an easy-to-use tool that provides the ability to not only find the optimal design of your system infrastructure but also deliver the optimal control of the individual components for minimal carbon emissions and cost. Participants will only require a laptop that has either Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge built on Chromium. 

#### Vendor Session: Meet Modelon Impact – a cloud platform for virtually designing, simulating, and analyzing industrial systems. 
What happens when you combine the power of cloud technology with powerful system modeling and simulation? The emergence of cutting-edge MBSE application possibilities for commercial utilization. In this session, we’ll walk through real-world examples of how Modelon Impact goes beyond the traditional use of Modelica-based system simulation tools. We’ll also discuss the most recent updates to Modelon’s Modelica libraries, Modelon Impact, as well as what users can expect from the platform and its libraries in the near future.
