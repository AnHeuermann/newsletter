Dear Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP, eFMI interested,

The Modelica Association plans to organize the next International Modelica Conference in **March or April 2023** as hybrid event.
We are looking for a **local organizer**. In case you are interested, please contact me.
Note, the Modelica Association Backoffice can provide technical support, especially with the proceedings.

The **[American Modelica Conference 2022](https://2022.american.conference.modelica.org/)** will take place in Dallas, U.S.A, 
**Oct. 26-28, 2022** as a **hybrid** conference event. Full papers to be reviewed should be sent by **May 1, 2022**.
For more details, see the [article in this newsletter](#amc_2022).

The **Asian Modelica Conference 2022** will take place as an **online** conference **Nov. 24-25, 2022**.
In case the COVID-19 restriction is lifted, the organizers try to keep an option
for a hybrid conference by adding one or half a day on-site workshop/tutorials before the conference
at Sophia University in Tokyo, Japan. More information will follow soon.

The Modelica Association is planning to release a [Compliance and anti trust statement](https://github.com/modelica/MA-Bylaws/pull/7/files/85143d4ec67c3ae3ce50300897d9c052cab94545) 
(based on corresponding guidelines in the ISO standards development process ) at the Annual Modelica Association meeting
on May 10, 2022. Feel free to inspect and comment the [pull request #7](https://github.com/modelica/MA-Bylaws/pull/7). 

If you have interesting news for the Modelica, FMI, SSP, DCP, eFMI communities,
please follow the [submission guidelines](https://newsletter.modelica.org/submission-guidelines.html).
The deadline for articles for the next newsletter is Fr. July 15, 2022.
